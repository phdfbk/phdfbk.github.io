Corsalini,Matteo,University of Siena,,Italy,Religion of Innovation," Matteo’s PhD project addresses the relation between new forms of spirituality and the law in the field of for-profit corporations. On the threshold of post-modern and post-secular societies, by assuming that innovation has become a vehicle for quasi-religious discourses, his research  focuses on whether economic growth, unfettered profit-seeking and financial wellness has become itself a new option of faith. Hence, against this background, are  we witnessing to the rise of corporate religious freedom in Europe?  Were this question  to be answered in the affirmative, then, how should the law  deal with the new spiritual/quasi-religious conceptions of the good of business activities?",Ventura Marco,"religion, post-modern, post-secular societies",,corsalini.jpg,matteo.corsalini@me.com,34

Feltracco,Anna,University of Pavia,,Italy,Linguistica Computazionale,"My research is mainly focused on the study of opposition relations at lexical level as a source of contradiction at textual level. Detecting oppositions, both among words and among portions of text, is a fundamental requirement for text analysis. Indeed, textual opposition plays a crucial role in applications such as machine translation, discourse understanding, and information retrieval. In the first year, I have mainly focused the research on the study of opposition relation among verbs. I have studied opposition relation taking in consideration that i) opposition relation is among senses of verbs, and ii) there exist different types of opposition relation with different characteristics. The future steps of my research project aims at studying cases in which an opposition relation between two verbs lead to a contradiction among pairs of sentences. The study of contradiction also requires the analysis of the conditions in which this relation occurs, both at sentence and at text level. In fact, the presence of a lexical opposition alone is not a sufficient condition for contradiction to exist: the opposite items need to be referred to the same entity/event. Consequently, for a complete study on contradiction, also co-reference need to be study from both a theoretical /linguistic and a computational point of view.",Magnini Bernardo,"Lexical Studies, Natural language Processing, Human Language Technology",https://hlt-nlp.fbk.eu/people/profile/feltracco,feltracco.jpg,feltracco@fbk.eu,30

Demissie,Biniam Fisseha,University of Trento,,Ethiopia,Automatic Generation of Security Test Cases for Inter-Component Communication Vulnerabilities,"Software systems are composed of multiple components. Components hold special privileges to perform different tasks. Controlled access to system resources is achieved through permission based security model. In order to gain privileges, a malicious component usually has to abuse a privileged component. This phenomenon is commonly known as the confused deputy attack. Confused deputy attack occurs when a privileged component performs an activity that needs special permission on behalf of other component that does not have the required permission. Static analysis is often used to detect existence of this vulnerability. However, reports of static analysis are vulnerability points rather than conditions that cause the vulnerability. Therefore, a developer that wishes to fix this vulnerability has to manually analyze the code in order to understand the conditions that cause the vulnerability. Similar to other permission based systems, the Android system also suffers from the confused deputy attack called permission redelegation. In our work, we investigate different approaches on how to automatically generate test cases that reveal permission redelegation vulnerabilities in Android apps. Test cases help developers easily trace, identify and fix the vulnerabilities. The test cases are also used to verify if the applied fix has resolved the vulnerability or not.",Ceccato Mariano,"Software Engineering, security testing, android apps, software analysis, static analysis",https://se.fbk.eu/people/profile/demissie,demissie.jpg,demissie@fbk.eu,30

Harikumar,Aravind,University of Trento,,India,Remote sensing for environmental monitoring,"Forests are an extremely important natural resource that need to be preserved for obvious environmental and economic reasons. An efficient forest management is essential for effective forest preservation. However such management demands an accurate inventory of biophysical parameters, such as the tree/crown height, the crown width, the biomass, which are costly to estimate by conducting on-site visits. In addition, the tree species information is also very essential for improving the accuracy of estimation. With the advancements in the airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing technology, it has become possible to capture three dimensional (3D) information of forests at the individual tree level in a much reliable and economical way. The high density multi-return airborne LiDAR data can provide a huge amount of spatial details about forest components, and hence can be used for accurately extracting the tree crowns and species information, which can facilitate the ultimate objective of accurate biophysical parameter estimation. Accurate modelling of the internal crown structure of the tree is necessary for extracting species information. Also, the information in the LiDAR data can be better exploited for accurate biophysical parameter estimation, by developing novel methodologies which incorporate the ability of Sparse methods in finding the prominent patterns in the data. Thus, the overall objectives of this proposal are to: 1) develop methods for identifying the species of trees belonging to the same tree-genera using high density airborne LiDAR data, 2) develop novel methods for 3D tree crown delineation in high density multi-return airborne LiDAR data, and 3) develop fully automatic biophysical parameter estimation techniques, by giving special emphasis on exploiting the capabilities of Sparse methods.",Bovolo Francesca,"Remote Sensing, Airborne Laser Scanner, LiDAR, Tree Species detection, Biophysical parameter estimation, modelling",https://rsde.fbk.eu/people/profile/harikumar,harikumar.jpg,harikumar@fbk.eu,30

Merzi,Stefano,University of Trento,,Italy,Application of novel position-sensitive Silicon PhotoMultipliers to medical imaging,"The Silicon Photo-multiplier (SiPM) is replacing the photomultiplier tube in several applications because of its solid-state nature, its better performance and customization level. Different position-sensitive SiPM (PS-SiPM) architectures have been proposed during the past few years. They allow the position of the light impinging on the SiPM active area to be identified using a limited number of readout channels, with an ultimate precision in the order of tens of microns and a sensitivity down to the single photon. The most important applications of PS-SiPMs are currently in the field of medical imaging, in which a scintillator is used for the detection of gamma-ray or X-ray photons. The PS-SiPM is used for the readout of the pixelated or monolithic scintillator with 2-dimensional position sensitivity and very good timing resolution. In this context, FBK has recently developed a new type of PS-SiPM, called Lineraly-Graded SiPM (LG-SiPM), showing beyond stateof-the-art performance during preliminary measurements. The PhD activity will focus on the research and development optimization of this technology, aiming at improving its performance and at extending its potential applications, within the current research programs of TIFPA and FBK.",Gola Alberto,"SiPM, position-sensitive, medical imaging",,merzi.jpg,smerzi@fbk.eu,32

Pirrone,Davide,University of Trento,,Italy,Change detection methodologies for multi-temporal SAR images,"In the remote sensing, modern Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems have capabilities of acquiring data raising spatial resolution to sub-meter level and/or controlling the wave polarization of both transmitted and received waves. These represent a powerful tool for the multi-temporal analysis of changes in natural and urban areas. If we consider urban areas, SAR image potential in the analysis of small changes (i.e., smaller than the building size) is not fully exploited yet. These changes are associated to specific patterns of amplitude backscattering variation, if we consider same polarization for the incident and the scattered wave; or other parameter, if we consider data with multiple polarization. Thus, my research activity aims at developing backscattering models for changes affecting parts of the buildings (i.e., the roof or one of the façades) It also aims at designing novel advanced methodologies for the detection of changes in multi-temporal SAR images, which exploits the information from the higher level of detail and the different combinations of wave polarization.",Bovolo Francesca,"Remote Sensing, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Change Detection, Multi-temporal image analysis, Image Processing",https://it.linkedin.com/in/davide-pirrone-41aa552b,pirrone.jpg,pirrone@fbk.eu,30

However, these protocols suffer from overhearing and idle listening causing considerable energy waste. This energy wastage can be greatly reduced by using a secondary ultra-low power wake-up radio to completely switch off the main radio and only wake it up when there is communication. To date, most effort has been devoted to the hardware level, but no consideration has been dedicated to the design of communication protocols based on wake-up radios. To exploit the full potential of wake-up radios, cross-layer integration at the higher level is required. My research work focuses on the design of novel wake-up radio MAC and Routing protocols with evaluation using test-beds and real-life deployments.",Murphy Amy Lynn,"wake-up radios, energy-efficiency, duty-cycling, LE-IoT, selective awakening, radio-on-demand",www.rajeevpiyare.com,piyare.jpg,piyare@fbk.eu,30

Strong authentication protocols provide additional security by requiring the user to provide at least two independent proofs of identity for the authentication to succeed. With this work, we want to provide some tools for the analysis and the testing of a specific kind of security protocols: the Strong Authentication Protocols involving mobile devices. These security protocols are widely used for restricting access to critical resources, while their analysis and testing procedure is not fully developed.
