research_topic: Centralized vs distributed Self-Organizing Network features in 5G Small Cell networks
abstract: Currently, I have been working on one of the next generations of cellular networks, LTE-LAA, and its co-existence possibilities with WIFI. The deployment of modern mobile systems has faced severe challenges due to the dramatically increase of users. The situation could be even worse by development of different wireless technologies in the same frequency band. Moreover, the usage of smaller cells (e.g. Micro, femto and wireless LAN), coexistence among heterogeneous networks (such as LTE and Wi-Fi deployed in the same frequency band) has been a big field of research in the academy and industry.
