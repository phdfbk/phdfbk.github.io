abstract: Spoken language consists of sequentially arrayed language units connected by statistical relations. Implicit Statistical Learning (SL) is a domain-general ability to learn structured sequential patterns which have been described as automatic, incidental, and spontaneous (Arciuli et al., 2012). Research has suggested it may underlie language acquisition starting from a really early age (Saffran, 2003). Some studies suggest that deaf children may lack of efficiency in this aspect of learning (Conway et al., 2007). The general purpose of my project is to investigate implicit and explicit language learning processes in children with deafness. It consists of two main phases&#58; a basic research and an applicative training-phase. I aim to deepen the current theoretical knowledge of Sequence Learning and Working Memory processes, and examine how these abilities relate to the linguistic outcomes of deaf children. The proficiency obtained by this research is contributing to the development of a serious-game, that will serve as a training. Hopefully, this could represent an innovative starting point for new therapies addressed to all those children who are showing difficulties in language learning, such as children with deafness or learning disabilities.
