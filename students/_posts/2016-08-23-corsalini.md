abstract:  Matteoâ€™s PhD project addresses the relation between new forms of spirituality and the law in the field of for-profit corporations. On the threshold of post-modern and post-secular societies, by assuming that innovation has become a vehicle for quasi-religious discourses, his research  focuses on whether economic growth, unfettered profit-seeking and financial wellness has become itself a new option of faith. Hence, against this background, are  we witnessing to the rise of corporate religious freedom in Europe?  Were this question  to be answered in the affirmative, then, how should the law  deal with the new spiritual/quasi-religious conceptions of the good of business activities?
